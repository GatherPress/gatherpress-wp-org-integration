# gatherpress-wp-org-integration
Development of GatherPress integration with wordpress.org

This repository has been created to separate the development of the plugin itself (see the [main plugin repository](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress)) to the specific needs for the integration of GatherPress in the WordPress.org network.

The GatherPress plugin can be used as any plugin on any site, but the integration with the WordPress.org network needs specific features.
We are identifying the needs for it with the WordPress Community and Meta teams.

You can follow in the [Project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/GatherPress/projects/2) and as issues here.
